            <h3>Making Our Lives Beautiful is Only in Our Hands </h3>
            <p>Life has been a really tough roller coaster for me.I've always wondered what I actually want from my
                life?
                Until I got CSE for my undergrade. I am very thankful to almighty allah because he never let me choose
                anything wrong in my life. Whatever I pick consiously or unconsiously ,Allah has always turned that into
                a
                blessings Mashallah and I get to realize that fact today or tomorrow but eventually I do realize. Now
                that I
                have chance of becoming a Web Developer, I'm trying my best to see my capabilities and how far can I
                extend
                to become the person which I want to see in myself in next five to six years.</p>
