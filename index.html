            <h3>Making Our Lives Beautiful is Only in Our Hands </h3>
            <p>Life has been a really tough roller coaster for me.I've always wondered what I actually want from my
                life?
                Until I got CSE for my undergrade. I am very thankful to almighty allah because he never let me choose
                anything wrong in my life. Whatever I pick consiously or unconsiously ,Allah has always turned that into
                a
                blessings Mashallah and I get to realize that fact today or tomorrow but eventually I do realize. Now
                that I
                have chance of becoming a Web Developer, I'm trying my best to see my capabilities and how far can I
                extend
                to become the person which I want to see in myself in next five to six years.</p>

            <p>I've already learned the basic HTML and CSS. I can build any simple website. I can even teach how to
                make simple website. My goal is to build 3 websites and learn advanced topics. I'm hoping to introduce
                myself as a Senior Web Developer in future. </p>

                <p>I am the master of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                    efficient.
                    I didn't stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue JS. I
                    even
                    know
                    the deployment, server and security. I will give you 100% web solution.</p>

                <p>Some people didn't thought that I can really do something significant on CSE field. But I made myself
                    as
                    a Junior Web Developer. I made quite a website and showed it to many ones. They all liked it and
                    appreciated it. It was fun proving myself infront of everyone.</p>
